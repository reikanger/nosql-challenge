# NoSQL Challenge

## Background
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. This project evaluated some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Note: Open the `NoSQL_analysis.ipynb` and `NoSQL_setup.ipynb` files in [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)

Note: Run the code in `NoSQL_setup.ipynb` first, before `NoSQL_analysis.ipynb`, in order to set up the Mongo database.

## Repository Contents
- `NoSQL_setup.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook that documents importing the data and sets up the database for analysis
- `NoSQL_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook that contains code that analyzes the UK Food Standards Agency data
- `Resources/establishments.json` - Copy of the data provided by the UK Food Standards Agency
